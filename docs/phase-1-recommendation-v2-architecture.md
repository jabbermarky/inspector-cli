# Phase 1 - Recommendation V2 Architecture Design

## Overview

Phase 1 of the V2 recommender migration has been completed. This phase established the core architecture and interfaces for the RecommendationAnalyzerV2 system.

## Completed Components

### 1. RecommendationSpecificData Interface (recommendation-types-v2.ts)

The complete V2 type system has been defined with:
- **Core recommendation data structure** with three main categories
- **Learn recommendations** - filtering, retention, and refinement
- **Detect-CMS recommendations** - emerging patterns, vendor-based, semantic, and technology stack opportunities
- **Ground truth recommendations** - statistically validated, technology-based, and semantic category rules
- **Cross-analyzer intelligence types** - evidence chains, confidence scoring, and analyzer agreement
- **Bias-aware assessment types** - risk levels, mitigation strategies, and transparency reporting
- **Quality metrics** - comprehensive measurement of recommendation quality

Key features:
- Zero `any` types for complete type safety
- Discriminated unions for polymorphic data
- Comprehensive error type hierarchy
- Type guards for runtime validation
- Read-only properties for immutability

### 2. RecommendationAnalyzerV2 Class

The analyzer class implements the FrequencyAnalyzer<RecommendationSpecificData> interface with:

#### Core Methods
- `analyze()` - Main entry point that orchestrates all recommendation generation
- `setAggregatedResults()` - Receives cross-analyzer data
- `setBiasAnalysis()` - Sets bias-specific data
- `setValidationResults()` - Sets validation pipeline results

#### Learn Recommendation Methods
- `generateLearnRecommendations()` - Orchestrates all learn recommendations
- `generateFilteringRecommendations()` - Creates header filtering recommendations
- `generateAdvancedFilteringRecommendation()` - Sophisticated single-header analysis
- `calculateMultiFactorConfidence()` - Weighted confidence scoring
- `determineFilteringAction()` - Decision logic for filter/keep/conditional

#### Helper Methods
- `buildCrossAnalyzerContext()` - Constructs unified analyzer data access
- `buildMultiFactorReasoning()` - Creates comprehensive reasoning chains
- `collectCrossAnalyzerEvidence()` - Gathers evidence from all analyzers
- `assessBiasRisk()` - Evaluates bias impact on recommendations
- `calculateEnhancedDiversity()` - Multi-dimensional diversity metrics

### 3. Cross-Analyzer Intelligence Pattern

The architecture establishes a pattern for leveraging data from all V2 analyzers:

```typescript
interface CrossAnalyzerContext {
  headers?: AnalysisResult<HeaderSpecificData>;
  semantic?: AnalysisResult<SemanticSpecificData>;
  vendor?: AnalysisResult<VendorSpecificData>;
  cooccurrence?: AnalysisResult<CooccurrenceSpecificData>;
  discovery?: AnalysisResult<PatternDiscoverySpecificData>;
  validation?: AnalysisResult<ValidationSpecificData>;
  bias?: AnalysisResult<BiasSpecificData>;
  technologies?: AnalysisResult<any>;
}
```

This enables sophisticated multi-factor analysis where each recommendation considers:
- Header frequency and distribution (from HeaderAnalyzer)
- Semantic categorization and meaning (from SemanticAnalyzerV2)
- Vendor and technology associations (from VendorAnalyzerV2)
- Co-occurrence relationships (from CooccurrenceAnalyzerV2)
- Emerging patterns (from PatternDiscoveryV2)
- Statistical validation (from ValidationPipelineV2)
- Bias assessment (from BiasAnalyzerV2)

### 4. Statistical Confidence Scoring System

**Real Statistical Implementation** using existing statistical utilities:

Multi-factor confidence calculation with weighted components:
- Frequency weight: 25% (using statistical thresholds)
- Semantic classification: 15%
- Vendor specificity: 15%
- Bias adjustment: 20%
- Relationship strength: 10%
- Statistical significance: 15% (using power analysis)

**Statistical Methods Integrated:**
- **Binomial significance testing** for pattern reliability against baseline rates
- **Power analysis** to adjust confidence based on sample size adequacy
- **Standard error calculations** for confidence interval uncertainty measurement
- **Sanity checks** for frequency consistency validation
- **Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests** for independence testing (available for Phase 2)

**Confidence Uncertainty Calculation:**
- Uses standard error for proportions: `sqrt((p * (1-p)) / n)`
- 95% confidence intervals with margin of error calculations
- Caps uncertainty at 50% for extreme cases

**Statistical Constants Applied:**
- Alpha level: 0.05 (5% significance)
- Power threshold: 0.8 (80% statistical power)
- High correlation threshold: 0.7 (70%)
- Minimum sample size: 30 for normal approximation

Confidence levels determined with statistical rigor:
- **Very-high**: ≥85% confidence AND <10% uncertainty
- **High**: ≥70% confidence AND <15% uncertainty  
- **Medium**: ≥50% confidence AND <25% uncertainty
- **Low**: Below medium thresholds

### 5. Evidence and Reasoning System

Each recommendation includes comprehensive statistical evidence:
- **Primary reason** - Main justification for the recommendation
- **Supporting factors** - Additional evidence supporting the decision  
- **Risk factors** - Potential concerns or limitations
- **Statistical basis** - Real p-values from binomial/chi-square/Fisher tests
- **Algorithmic logic** - Statistical ensemble parameters and thresholds
- **Cross-analyzer evidence** - Supporting data from each analyzer with confidence scores

**Statistical Validation Integration:**
- Binomial test results for pattern significance
- Power analysis results for sample adequacy
- Frequency consistency validation using sanity checks
- Statistical uncertainty quantification with confidence intervals

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Native V2 Processing** - Direct consumption of PreprocessedData without conversions
2. **Cross-Analyzer Intelligence** - Leverages insights from all analyzers
3. **Statistical Rigor** - Real statistical calculations using existing utilities
4. **Type Safety** - Complete type coverage with zero `any` types
5. **Extensibility** - Easy to add new recommendation types or analyzers
6. **Transparency** - Comprehensive reasoning and evidence for each recommendation
7. **Bias Awareness** - Built-in bias detection and mitigation
8. **Scientific Validity** - Proper p-values, confidence intervals, and power analysis

## Next Steps

Phase 2 will implement:
- Complete learn recommendation algorithms
- Retention recommendation logic
- Refinement suggestion generation
- Bias mitigation strategies
- Enhanced diversity analysis

The foundation is now in place for sophisticated, cross-analyzer intelligent recommendations that leverage the full power of the V2 architecture.
