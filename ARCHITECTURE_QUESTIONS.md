# Centralized Architecture Design Questions

This document contains key questions to answer when designing the centralized data architecture for expanding Inspector CLI to include a Browser Extension while sharing core logic and data.

## üéØ Core Architecture Questions

### 1. Data Centralization Strategy
- What type of centralized data store are you considering? (Cloud database, local database with sync, hybrid approach?)
- Should the data be shared across all users, or private per-user with optional sharing?
- What data needs to be centralized? (Detection results, training data, user preferences, or all?)

### 2. Browser Extension Scope
- What would the browser extension do? (Detect CMS on current page, bulk analyze tabs, contribute training data?)
- Should it work offline or require internet connectivity?
- Would it display results in-browser or sync for later analysis?

### 3. Logic Sharing Strategy
- How much logic should be shared vs. platform-specific?
- Are you thinking of a monorepo with shared packages, or separate repositories?
- Should the core detection logic run in both environments, or centralized on a server?

## üîß Technical Architecture Questions

### 4. Runtime Environment Challenges
- Browser extensions can't run Puppeteer - how would you handle browser automation?
- Would the extension analyze the current DOM directly, or send data to a service?
- How would you handle the Node.js vs browser API differences?

### 5. Data Flow & Synchronization
- Should detection happen locally (CLI/extension) with results synced to central store?
- Or should detection happen on a central service with local clients?
- How would you handle offline scenarios?

## üöÄ Business & User Experience Questions

### 6. User Value Proposition
- What problems would the browser extension solve that the CLI doesn't?
- Would users install it for personal use, or would it be for professionals/agencies?
- Should there be different feature sets for different user types?

### 7. Deployment & Distribution
- Would you need a backend service/API, or could it work with just a database?
- How would you handle Chrome Web Store vs. Firefox Add-ons distribution?
- What's your target user base size?

## üí° Potential Architecture Patterns

Consider these architectural approaches:

### Hub-and-Spoke Pattern
- Central service with CLI and extension as clients
- All detection logic runs on central server
- Local clients are thin, focused on UI/UX

### Shared Core Pattern
- Common detection logic packaged for different runtimes
- Shared npm packages with platform-specific adapters
- Logic runs locally on each platform

### Federated Pattern
- Local detection with centralized aggregation
- Each client does its own detection
- Results are synchronized to central store

### Hybrid Pattern
- Browser extension for discovery/lightweight detection
- CLI for deep analysis and batch processing
- Central store for shared results and training data

## üéØ Success Criteria

Define what success looks like:
- Performance requirements (detection speed, data sync time)
- User adoption targets
- Platform coverage goals
- Development/maintenance complexity limits

## üìù Next Steps

1. Answer the questions above
2. Choose architectural pattern
3. Design data schema for centralized store
4. Create proof-of-concept for shared logic
5. Implement browser extension MVP
6. Test integration between CLI and extension
