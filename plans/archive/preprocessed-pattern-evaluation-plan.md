# Evaluation Plan: Preprocessed Pattern Detection vs. LLM Pattern Discovery

## Objective
Evaluate whether preprocessing raw data into standardized patterns before LLM analysis provides better accuracy, consistency, and cost-effectiveness compared to current LLM-based pattern discovery.

## Evaluation Framework

### 1. **Baseline Establishment**
- Run current phased analysis on validation datasets (REALLY-GOOD files)
- Document current accuracy, pattern discovery rates, and token usage
- Identify current failure modes (token limits, inconsistent naming, missed patterns)

### 2. **Preprocessing Implementation**
- Extend ground-truth system to detect ALL patterns (not just discriminative ones)
- Create comprehensive pattern detection covering:
  - All hybrid pattern types from expected-patterns files
  - Additional patterns found in LLM analysis but not in ground-truth
  - Edge cases and variations discovered during testing
- Generate standardized pattern arrays as LLM input

### 3. **Comparative Analysis Dimensions**

#### **Accuracy Comparison**
- Pattern detection accuracy: Ground-truth vs. LLM discovery
- False positive/negative rates for each approach
- CMS classification accuracy using each method
- Pattern completeness against expected-patterns files

#### **Consistency Evaluation**
- Pattern naming consistency across multiple runs
- Reproducibility of results (same input → same output)
- Standardization quality (hybrid format compliance)

#### **Discovery Capability Assessment**
- Novel pattern discovery: What does LLM find that ground-truth misses?
- Pattern relationship analysis: Can LLM still identify meaningful correlations?
- Edge case handling: Unusual implementations, variations, custom configurations

#### **Operational Metrics**
- Token usage reduction (current vs. preprocessed)
- Processing time comparison
- Cost analysis (API calls, compute resources)
- Failure rate due to token limits

### 4. **Test Dataset Strategy**

#### **Primary Validation Sets**
- REALLY-GOOD CSV files (known CMS types with 100% expected accuracy)
- Previously failed sites (token limit issues)
- Edge cases: custom implementations, hybrid sites, heavily modified CMS

#### **Secondary Analysis Sets**
- Large enterprise sites (high token usage currently)
- Sites with multiple CMS signatures
- Sites with minimal patterns (low signal cases)

### 5. **Evaluation Methodology**

#### **Phase 1: Side-by-Side Comparison**
- Run both approaches on same dataset
- Compare pattern detection results
- Measure accuracy against known ground truth
- Document discrepancies and analyze causes

#### **Phase 2: Hybrid Approach Testing**
- Test combined approach: ground-truth patterns + selective raw content
- Evaluate optimal balance between preprocessing and LLM discovery
- Identify which content types benefit most from each approach

#### **Phase 3: Production Simulation**
- Scale testing to larger datasets
- Measure real-world performance differences
- Evaluate maintenance overhead (updating ground-truth vs. prompt tuning)

### 6. **Success Criteria**

#### **Must-Have Improvements**
- Token usage reduction >50%
- Pattern detection accuracy ≥95% vs. current approach
- Elimination of token limit failures
- Consistent hybrid pattern naming

#### **Nice-to-Have Benefits**
- Novel pattern discovery capability preserved
- Processing time reduction
- Reduced API costs
- Easier debugging and validation

### 7. **Risk Assessment**

#### **Technical Risks**
- Ground-truth detection gaps (patterns LLM finds but we miss)
- Loss of contextual analysis capability
- Maintenance burden of comprehensive pattern detection
- Pattern evolution (new CMS versions, new patterns)

#### **Mitigation Strategies**
- Maintain LLM discovery capability for unknown patterns
- Regular ground-truth validation against LLM findings
- Fallback to raw content analysis for edge cases
- Continuous pattern database updates

### 8. **Decision Framework**

#### **Go/No-Go Criteria**
- **Go**: >90% accuracy retention, >50% token reduction, eliminates token limits
- **Hybrid**: 80-90% accuracy but significant operational benefits
- **No-Go**: <80% accuracy or loss of critical discovery capabilities

#### **Implementation Path**
- Parallel deployment initially (both approaches available)
- Gradual migration based on use case (bulk analysis vs. discovery research)
- Maintain LLM discovery for research and pattern database updates

## Deliverables
1. Comprehensive accuracy comparison report
2. Token usage and cost analysis
3. Pattern discovery gap analysis
4. Recommended implementation strategy
5. Updated system architecture proposal

This evaluation would give us data-driven insights into whether the preprocessing approach delivers on its promise while identifying any critical gaps we'd need to address.
