Clarifying Questions

1. Current Testing Setup

- Are you currently testing with specific model(s)? Which ones?
  **answer**: I believe all testing has been done with the default model. I tried overriding the learn command on the command line.

- Do you have a standardized test dataset (like the good-drupal.csv) for consistency testing?
  **answer**: I have 4 csv files with known good sites, separated by known CMS.

- How do you want to measure/validate improvements between phases?
  **answer**: pattern naming consistency is most important for clustering; confidence is secondary.

2. Implementation Scope

- Should I focus only on the individual learn command, or also include cross-site analysis and meta-analysis modes?
  **answer**: focus on individual to start.

- Do you want to maintain backward compatibility with existing learn command outputs?
  **answer**: it's not necessary.

- Should the multi-phase approach be transparent to users or involve multiple command invocations?
  **answer**: should be transparent to users; it may be desirable to give progress indication if the prompt is taking a long time.

3. Testing Strategy

- What's your preference for A/B testing between approaches (old vs new prompts)?
  **answer**: we should collect data for existing design and save it, and then compare against it.

- Should we test with multiple models in parallel (GPT-4o, Gemini, etc.) to compare consistency?
  **answer**: yes.

- How many test runs per configuration would be sufficient for consistency measurement?
  **answer**: let's start with the test files I have which is 4 groups of 10. we need don't need every individual one, but we have a good starting base.

4. Success Metrics

- How should we quantify "consistency improvement"? (e.g., % of identical pattern names across same sites, confidence score
  variance, etc.)
  **answer**: suggest something.

- What's an acceptable confidence score variance for the same pattern across different sites?
  **answer**: for known patterns especially where the CMS name is included in the pattern, these should have extremely low variance if any.

- Should we prioritize pattern name consistency or confidence score consistency first?
  **answer**: focus on pattern name consistency first.

5. Rollback Strategy

- If the multi-phase approach doesn't improve consistency, should we have fallback options ready?
  **answer**: we can use git for fallback. may want to do a commit before we start the plan.

- Do you want to preserve the current single-phase approach as a backup option?
  **answer**: it's in git.

Key Assumptions to Confirm

Technical Assumptions

1. API Cost Tolerance: Multi-phase approach will increase API costs (2x calls per analysis) - is this acceptable?
   **answer**: yes. we will optimize later.

2. Response Time: Multi-phase will be slower - what's the maximum acceptable increase?
   **answer**: time increase is acceptable for now. we will optimize later.

3. Intermediate Storage: Phase 1 output needs to be stored/passed to Phase 2 - temporary storage is acceptable?
   **answer**: yes, temp storage is fine. create a tmp folder

Scope Assumptions

1. Focus on Individual Learn Command: Plan primarily targets single-URL learn analysis first, then extend to batch modes?
   **answer**: I think that we can read a batch of URLs which are individually analyzed first. we dont' need cross-site analysis or meta-analysis yet.

2. Pattern Standardization Priority: Focus on the pattern naming consistency issue before tackling confidence score
   variance?
   **answer**: yes.

3. Model Selection Testing: Plan should include testing multiple models to find the most consistent performer?
   **answer**: yes.

Success Criteria Assumptions

1. Target Consistency: Same pattern should have identical names across 90%+ of detections?
   **answer**: higher.
2. Confidence Variance: Same pattern confidence should vary by <0.1 across similar sites?
   **answer**: yes.
3. Backward Compatibility: Existing analysis storage and display systems should continue working?
   **answer**: not needed.
