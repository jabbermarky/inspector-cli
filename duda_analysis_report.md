### Verification
All example sites contain the core Duda signals:
- JavaScript variables: `window.Parameters = window.Parameters`
- Site type identifier: `SiteType: atob('RFVEQU9ORQ==')` (DUDAONE)
- Product identifier: `productId: 'DM_DIRECT'`
- CSS selector: `BlockContainerSelector: '.dmBody'`

## Implementation Recommendations

### High-Priority Duda Detection Patterns
Implement detection for these signals in order of reliability:

1. **Core JavaScript Patterns** (99%+ accuracy):
   ```javascript
   window.Parameters = window.Parameters
   SiteType: atob('RFVEQU9ORQ==')
   productId: 'DM_DIRECT'
   ```

2. **DOM Selectors** (99%+ accuracy):
   ```css
   BlockContainerSelector: '.dmBody'
   ```

3. **CDN Resources** (85-90% accuracy):
   ```
   irp.cdn-website.com
   lirp.cdn-website.com
   SystemID: 'US_DIRECT_PRODUCTION'
   ```

### Confidence Scoring
- Sites with 3+ core signals: **95%+ confidence**
- Sites with 2 core signals: **90%+ confidence**  
- Sites with 1 core signal + CDN: **85%+ confidence**

### Additional Patterns to Consider
```javascript
// Other Duda-specific patterns found
'dudamobile.com'
'dmalbum'
'dmRespImg'
'duda_website_builder'
'_duda_'
```
